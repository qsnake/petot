You can generate two executable codes: PEtot, Pmoment. 
The main code is PEtot. To make them, you need to do:

(1) copy the appropriate Makefile.Machine to Makefile. 
    If you are not using T3E or IBM SP, you might need 
    to edit the Makefile yourself. 

(2) Edit all the system_xxxx.f programs, uncomment the 
    program lines corresponding to the machine you are using. 
    This is easy to do for T3E and IBM-SP user. 
    If you are not using T3E or IBM SP, you might need 
    to provide the adequate subroutines in those programs. 

(3) For IBM-SP user, link the lapack library:
    > module load lapack

(4) type >make PEtot
         >make Pmoment
    You are done.
