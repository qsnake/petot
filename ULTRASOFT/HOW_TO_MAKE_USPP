 (0)   You first need to compile the executable runatom.x, and place 
       that in the Bin directory. (if you use IBM SP machine, you don't
       need to recompile, the executable in this package should work 
       for you).    

 (1)   Go to D. Vanderbilt's ultrasoft pp Website: 
       http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/uspp/#CONTRIB
 (2)   Double click on one element of the (green/blue) periodic table. 
 (3)   Now, you might see a few subdirectories, corresponding to a few 
       possible uspp's for this element. Click on the one you like to use 
       (however, for most of the elements, there is only one choice). 
 (4)   Download the Makefile and all the xxx.adat file, and place them 
       in a directory: Work/xxx_atom/sub_xxx_atom/. Note xxx_atom (xxx is 
       the atomic number, atom is the atom name, e.g, 047-Ag) is a directory
       for this element; sub_xxx_atom is a subdirectory for one particular uspp 
       for this element. It is a good idea to keep the original name (from the
       website) for sub_xxx_atom. For example: 047-Ag-gpw-n-campos). Note this
       directory structure cannot be changed, since that is used in the Makefile. 
 (5)   Inside this subdirectory, just type >make,  it will make the xxx.uspp 
       pseudopotential file for you. You can copy the uspp.atom in the Pot file 
       for you future use. Only the atom_ae_ref.adat (e.g, ag_ae_ref.adat) and 
       atom_ps.adat (e.g, ag_ps.adat) are used in >make. All the other files are 
       used in >make test. But it is a good idea to download all the files.  

       You can also try: >make install, >make clean, >make test.
