The runatom.x program generates pseudopotentials (*.uspp files)
in a binary format using "unformatted" fortran write statements.
Unfortunately, different computers may expect unformatted datafiles
to be in different internal formats.  This may cause problems when
trying to move *.uspp files between different computer systems.

The most standard format is the IEEE one; it is used by default
on most Unix and Linux systems.  However, on some systems (such
as DEC/COMPAQ compilers for Alphas) a different default may be
in place.  In such cases, it is recommended to choose compiler
options that will force reading and writing in IEEE format.
See the Source/Makefile header for hints on how to do this.

However, if this proves problematic for one reason or another,
then the 'reform' program in the Utils/ directory can be used
to convert the pseudopotential datafiles from unformatted to
formatted form and vice versa.  See Utils/README.

(Note: if using ftp to transfer *.uspp files between computers,
be sure to set the 'binary' option.)
