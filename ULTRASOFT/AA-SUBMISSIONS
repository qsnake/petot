      SUBMISSIONS TO THE LIBRARY OF PSEUDOPOTENTIAL INPUT FILES
      ---------------------------------------------------------

Users who wish to contribute a set of pseudopotential input files
to be included in the library are strongly encouraged to do so.

Please try to follow the naming conventions in Work/README in
naming your subdirectory, and please try to follow the templates in
the Work/000-Ex/ regarding the contents of your directory and the
format of the Makefile.

In particular, please be sure to include a README file in your
directory, following a format similar to that of the examples
examples in Work/000-Ex/*/.  The more information you can include
about tests in the atomic, molecular, and solid-state environment,
the better!  Especially useful are convergence tests of properties
vs. plane-wave cutoff.

When ready, please:

-- Do 'make clean' in your subdirectory to clear out all but the
   Makefile and *.adat files.

-- Go one level above your subdirectory and type

      tar cf [name].tar [name]
      gzip [name].tar

   where [name] is the name of your subdirectory.

-- Email the [name].tar.gz file to me as an attachment.

We(*) will then make some effort to check that your pseudopotential
generates as expected and passes some minimal quality checks.
If accepted, the subdirectory will be installed in the master
distribution.

(*) Nicola Marzari and Marco Fornari have kindly offered to help
    with this process.  Other offers of help will be welcomed.
