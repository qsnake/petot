The program is designed to work correctly either with 'static' or
'automatic' allocation of arrays.  Most compilers use one of these
modes by default, but the other can be specified by an appropriate
compiler flag.  It is recommended to use the default choice.

There is a known problem with this version of the program when
compiling with the non-default 'automatic' allocation mode on the
DEC Alphas (ie, when using the "-automatic" flag to f77).  The
code seems to die by a segmentation fault upon entry into subroutine
besdiag at the very end of the program.  It is suspected to be a
compiler bug.  Alternatively it could be a bug in the program, but
it would have to be a strange one, as it has not shown up in tests
on other vendors' compilers.
