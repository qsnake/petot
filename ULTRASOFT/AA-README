     README FOR USPP 7.3.3 PSEUDOPOTENTIAL GENERATION PROGRAM
     --------------------------------------------------------

This distribution contains version 7.3.3 of the "ultrasoft
pseudopotential" (USPP) generation code from the group of
D. Vanderbilt, Rutgers University.

This code is freely distributed.  You may use it for your own
research purposes, or pass it on to others for similar use.
However, note the following restrictions:

1. The code is not guaranteed to be bug-free.

2. The quality of the pseudopotentials generated by the provided input
   files is not guaranteed.

3. No active support is provided for this package.

4. The code may not be used for profit-making purposes or
   included in any commercial code except by express arrangement.

Version uspp-7.3.3 should be functionally identical to the previous
distribution known as a7.3.2.  All the significant modifications
are in the "packaging," i.e., the directory structure, the
Makefiles, the sample files, etc.  Two important modifications are
that:

-- The GNU GPL License is now explicitly included as a header
   of each source file.  See Source/LICENSE.

-- The Work subdirectory contains a library of input files that
   can be used to generate a library of pseudopotentials that
   will hopefully grow to cover many atoms of the periodic table.

   **  NOTE: As of Jan 2002, there is only a single Ti potential
   **  in the library!  We hope to add to the library soon.

These changes were made with the intention that uspp-733 and
subsequent versions will be posted publically on the Web at
www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/uspp/ .

See the file AA-QUICK-START to find out how to compile and run
the program and generate the library of pseudopotentials.

Users who wish to experiment with generating their own
pseudopotentials should start by consulting the file Doc/DETAILS.
However, there is nothing like a "User Manual," so beware that
this process may not be entirely painless.

Users are strongly encouraged to donate their input files to expand
the library of available potentials.  See AA-SUBMISSIONS for more
information about how to do this.  Note that the version number
(currently 7.3.3) will NOT change just because of additions to the
library of input files.  Check the LAST-MODIFIED date in the Work/
directory to see if you have the latest version of the library.

See Source/README for a summary of improvements that were made to
the source codes from one release to the next.  More information
about the release history can also be found in the comments at the
beginning of the main program runatom.f.

Please direct comments or suggestions for improvement to David
Vanderbilt at dhv@physics.rutgers.edu.
