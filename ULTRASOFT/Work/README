This directory contains one subdirectory for each atom of the
periodic table for which pseudopotentials are available.

Please read the DISCLAIMER regarding the potentials in the library.

To find the potential of interest to you, move to the subdirectory
for the atom of interest.  Within each atom directory, there are
further subdirectories with a naming structure of the form

  nnn-Sy-xc-[nspdf]-label

where

  nnn-Sy is the atomic number and symbol

  xc is the type of exchange-correlation, which can be:

      ca   Ceperley-Alder
      wg   Wigner
      hl   Hedin-Lundquist
      gl   Gunnarson-Lundquist
      gbl  LDA (CA) + Becke88 + LYP GC xc
      gb   LDA (CA) + Becke88
      gbp  LDA (CA) + Becke88 + Perdew86 GC xc
      gpw  PW(91)
      gpbe PBE(96)

  [nspdf] is one or more of:

      n    Non-linear core correction included
      s    Semicore s shell included in valence
      p    Semicore p shell included in valence
      d    Semicore d shell included in valence
      f    Semicore f shell included in valence

  label is a unique label provided by the supplier of the potential

Examples:

  022-Ti-ca-sp-vgrp     Ti Ceperley-Alder potential with semicore s and p
  008-O-gpbe--marz01    Oxygen PBE potential with no semicore states

Each subdirectory should contain a 'Makefile,' any needed *.adat files,
and a README file.  See example subdirectories and README file in the
000-Ex/ subdirectory.
