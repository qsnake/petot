Introductory information
------------------------

This Ti potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group at the time.  I believe it has been used successfully
in a number of studies of TiO2 and of perovskite ferroelectrics.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Ti in oxides where it is in the 4+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Ti too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.

Summary of atomic transferability tests
---------------------------------------

Nothing to report.

-----------------
Solid-state tests
-----------------

** Report here any tests of the potential in molecular or solid-state
** environments.  Tests of bond length, lattice constant, bulk modulus,
** etc. as a function of plane-wave cutoff are especially useful.

Nothing to report.

Miscellaneous
-------------

** Guidelines or warnings about use.
** Relations to other submitted pseudopotentials.
** Etc.

Nothing to report.
