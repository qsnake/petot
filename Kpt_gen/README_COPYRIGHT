   These programs were written by Jame Bernard and Sverre Froyen
   when they were in National Renewabe Energy Laboratory (around
   1990).  

   The input file is modified by Lin-Wang Wang for the purpose of
   the current package. 

   Here we are only using part of the functions in the original package. 
   More specifically, we use them to generate the reduced k-pionts
   using the equivalent k-point scheme [S. Froyen, P.R.B 39, 3168(1989)]
   and the point-group symmetry operations around the (0.,0.,0.) point.
