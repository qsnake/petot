This directory contains samples and documentation files on how to 
run the PEtot package. You should first go to lsda_p, PSEUDO, Kpt-gen
to make the executable programs. 

The main program is PEtot (in lsda_p).  

To run this program: you need to prepare the following files:

-------------------------------------------------------------
etot.input     ! The main input file for PEtot
atom.config    ! contains the atomic positions and relax informations
vwr.atom       ! pseudopotential files (can be generated from PSEUDO)
symm.file      ! symmetry file, if you want to use symm. (from Kpt-gen)
kpt.file       ! k-point file, if you are not use only Gamma point (from Kpt-gen)
-------------------------------------------------------------
You also need file: "maskr" for real space Kleinman-Bylander pseudopotential
implementation (simply copy this file from the current directory).

To run the program, place the above files in the directory you are running, 
then type: 

>mpprun -n NPROC ./PEtot     (on T3E)
or
>poe ./PEtot -procs NPROC -rmpool 2 (or 1)  (on IBM SP)

here NPROC is the number of processors you want to use. 

You can also use a Batch job to run the program, see NERSC web site for how
to submit Batch jobs.

The program will dump a lot of stuff on the screen (give you a sense that the 
job is running), and will write a more concise result in file "report". 
Depending on the specification in etot.input, other output files might be
generated. During the run, it will generate some scratch files, e.g, ugiofilexxx. 
These files will be deleted after the run is finished successfully.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Another small executable: Pmoment in lsda_p, calculates the matrix elements
|<i|P|j>|^2 for optical transitions. To run it, you need to prepare:

moment.input   ! the input file to name the input wavefunction and kpt.file

Then to run it, type

>mpprun -n NPROC ./Pmoment (on T3E)
or
>poe ./Pmoment -procs NPROC -rmpool 2 (or 1)  (on IBM SP)

It will output a file: "pmatrix", containing the information for the
matrix elements. Note that the NPROC for the current Pmoment run must be the same
as the NPROC for the PEtot run which generated the wavefunction files.

The DOC_xxx files in this directory will explain each above file in detail.
