                  (I). GENERAL INFORMATION + COPYRIGHT ISSUES

     This is a planewave pseudopotential package. It contains: lsda_p 
     (the main program), Kpt_gen (the k-point generator), PSEUDO (the
     supporting pseudopotential generating package), DOC_EXAMPLE 
     (the documents and examples). 

     lsda_p package was developed by Lin-Wang Wang at NERSC, 
     Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, CA, email: lwwang@lib.gov,
     web site: http://www.nersc.gov/~linwang. The project was funded by
     U.S. Department of Energy. 
     
     The original serie code Etot was written by L.W. Wang when he was in 
     National Renewable Energy Lab, Golden, CO. 

     PEtot was parallelized by Andrew Canning and L.W. Wang at NERSC using
     standard MPI, and it uses the MPI parallel FFT code, developed by 
     Andrew Canning.  

     ******  See Section (II)  for the features of PEtot  *******

     The PSEUDO package was down loaded from Jose Luis Martins's web site:
     http://bohr.inesc.pt/~jlm/jlm.html,  with modifications, so that the
     resulting pseudopotential file can be used directly for PEtot calculation. 
     See the directory PSEUDO for more copyright issues for that package.  

     The Kpt_gen program was originally written by James E. Bernard and 
     Sverre Froyen, see that directory for more copyright issues.  

     The whole package can only be used for non-profit research. It is
     intended for U.S. Department of Energy research community, and especially
     for NERSC computer users.  

     It was tested in NERSC parallel computers: Cray T3E, and IBM SP, 
     althought we expect it to run smoothly on other platforms. 

     It is fine tunned for large scale electronic structure calculations. 
     With modest energy cutoff (e.g, Ecut=20Ryd), it can handle 
     thousand atoms with no problem. 

     Go to each directory, and read the "README" or "INSTALL" files in that
     directory, and find out what to do.

                   (II).  Features of PEtot

     (1) It is a planewave pseudopotential code. 

     (2) It uses norm conservation pseudopotentials. (We do plan to go beyond
         the current pseudopotential to reduce Ecut). 

     (3) It is written in Fortran 90 and parallelized using standard MPI.

     (4) It is mainly aimed for large scale electronic structure calculations
         (e.g., 100-1000 atoms). With modest Ecut (e.g, 25 Ryd), and 100 processors, 
         it can calculate thousand atom systems. 

     (5) It has both G-space and r-space Kleinman-Bylander nonlocal pseudopotential 
         implementation. For systems with number of atom larger than ~50, the real
         space implementation becomes faster. for r-space implementation, the original
         pseudopotential file is used, without the need for proprocessing, due
         to the use of a new algorithm (and a mask function from file  "maskr"). 

     (6) It uses the charge mixing self-consistent field (SCF) approach. It employs
         different charge mixing schemes: Puly-Kerker, Thomas-Fermi. The newly 
         developed Thomas-Fermi scheme stablizes many previously unstable large 
         scale systems under SCF. 
        
     (7) It has two schemes for electron wavefunction iterations: (1) Standard 
         conjugate gradient, (2) Residual minimization scheme. The residual minimization
         scheme reduce the need for wavefunction orthogonalization, thus effectively 
         reduces the computational time scaling from O(N^3) to O(N^2) for N~100 to a few
         thousands. 

     (8) It can do calculations for: LDA, LSDA, GGA. (But no spin-orbit coupling, thus 
         not for noncolinear magnetic system).   

     (9) It can calculate the forces on the atoms, and relax the atomic positions to 
         minimize the total energy using the BFGS algorithm (updating the Hession 
         matrix). However, it does not automatically relax unit cell itself (not
         designed for small compound system comprehensive analysis).

    (10) It takes the k-points and symmetry operations from the Kpt_gen directory in 
         this package. But it can only do point-group symm. No space group symmetry. 

    (11) It takes the pseudopotential files vwr.atom from the PSEUDO directory in 
         this package.

    (12) It is parallelized by distributing the G-vectors and the corresponding 
         wavefunction coefficients on different processors. In real space, the unit
         cell is divided into layers along the first dimension (n1), and distributed
         among different processors. 

    (13) Andrew Canning's special designed parallel Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) code
         is used for this program. It reaches perfect load balance in the G-space, 
         and minimizes the communication and operations taking the advantages of the 
         spherical structure of the initial G-vectors. It is also fine tunned for 
         NERSC computers (T3E and IBM SP).  

    (14) For multiple k-points, it stores the wavefunctions of the currently unused 
         k-points on disk, thus saves the memory space. 

    (15) It can restart using previous calculation results. 

    (16) It can be used in conjunction with Escan (another package produced by 
         Lin-Wang Wang), for large system nanostructure calculations.

               (III). Suggested Acknowledgement

    We are not asking for any co-authorship if you just downloaded the program and 
generated results by your own (I think you can do that if you follow the documentations
and instructions carefully). However, it will be a great help for the future development 
of this project if you can acknowledge the use of the current code in your research paper. 
The suggested acknowledgement could be: "The current results have been obtained through the
use of the PEtot code, which is developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, and can be  
downloaded from: http://www.lbl.gov/~linwang".  Even better, if you can forward me a 
copy, or just a title of the papers using this program, and including the suggested 
acknowledgement. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
               (IV). HELPS, etc. 

    If you are a NERSC user, I am happy to help you to use this code, especially on
the T3E and IBM SP machines. If you are within DOE research community, I am willing 
to help if it does not take a lot of time. If you are none of above, good luck, you 
are on your own. However, I am happy to hear your complains, comments, and suggestions
for more features. Your feedbacks are highly valued.
