 (We are using only the wavefunctions and potentials, not the KB
  operator generated by the package, so the bug reported in the
  website should not affect us. The KBCONV.f is wrong. But for
  our version, we do not use it. So, it is okay for this package). 
 
 Dr. Martins is the co-auther of the popular Troullier-Martins
 pseudopotential method, and this package is widely used. 

 This is provided to be a supporting package for the PEtot code, 
 and the underlined programs are copyrighted by several people, thus
 may only be used for non-profit research. 

 I have modified some of the routines a little bit, so they are fine
 tuned to the use of PEtot program. More specificly, I have made the 
 following changes:

 (1) input.f, so we have a free formatted input. (The input file, now
     called atom.input, is different from the original atom.dat, and 
     it combines atom.dat with kb.dat). 

 (2) added gen_vwr.f: it generates the pseudopotential file: vwr.atom, 
     which can be used directly for PEtot.

 (3) added pcc_poly.f and pcc_sin.f, use a slightlt different routine
     to generate the pseudo-core charge when core correction is used. 

 (4) related to item (3), the pseud2.f, pseudb.f, pseudk.f pseudo.f
     pseudt.f pseudv.f are modified, and a new nval_tmp variable is 
     passed in. 

 (5) modified lnplot.f lnplot_kb.f. 

   Attached is the original README file from the package of Jose Luis 
   Martins, it contains the copy right issues of this package. 
   I am not the owner of this package !

These programs are copyrighted by several people. You may use
them for non-profit research.

Sverre Froyen wrote the basic atomic program

Norman Troullier improved convergence, added a few extra pseudopotentials
and wrote some of the other programs.

Carlos Balbas and Jose Soler contributed the GGA subroutines

Manuel Maria Alemany and Peter Schuster worked on the plotting programs

To use follow the instructions in INSTALL

Report bugs, comments, improvements to jlmartins@inesc-mn.pt
or other people mentioned in the programs. But we can't
help you to get the program running: If you can't do it alone,
probably you shouldn't use it...

If you do not want the GGA option, get the 5.51 version, as it is 
more thoroughly tested!!!!!!!!!!!
